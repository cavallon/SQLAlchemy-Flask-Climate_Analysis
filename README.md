# Honolulu Climate Analysis with SQL-Alchemy and Flask

# Summary:

This project involves conducting a climate analysis for a vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii, using Python, SQLAlchemy, and Flask. The analysis includes exploring climate data, performing precipitation and station analyses, designing a Flask API to access the data, and creating static and dynamic routes to retrieve relevant information about weather conditions. Finally, the project follows coding conventions and formatting guidelines, including thorough commenting, for clarity and maintainability.
